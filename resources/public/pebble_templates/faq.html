            <dt>Why is the cooldown as long as it is?</dt>
            <dd>The time it takes to get a pixel is dynamic, and changes based on how many people are online. The cooldown time is longer when more users are online.</dd>
            <dt>Why does it say 0/6 pixels?</dt>
            <dd>This means that you are waiting for your next pixel. When you place a pixel, there is a cooldown for when you can place the next one. Over time, you can gain up to 6 "stacked" pixels to place at once.</dd>
            <dt>Why does it take so long to "stack" pixels?</dt>
            <dd>This is by design. It is better to place a pixel as soon as you get one. Pixel "stacking" is meant to give you a bump if you go AFK for a bit. It takes around 40 minutes to get a full 6/6 pixels, but it only takes around 3 minutes to place 6 pixels if you place them as soon as possible.</dd>
            <dt>How do I appeal a ban?</dt>
            <dd>Contact us on <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord</a> or send an appeal to our <a href="https://pxls.space/appeal" target="_blank">Google form</a> after reading the rules in the site's info panel.</dd>
            <dt>How do I make a template?</dt>
            <dd>A template is an image link that is posted in the template textbox in the settings panel so you can place over it on the canvas. You may use a regular image link to your pixel art, but many people use the 3rd party tool <a href="https://pxlsfiddle.com" target="_blank">PxlsFiddle</a> to turn pixel art into a fancier link. If you need to make pixel art yourself, you can use <a href="https://www.piskelapp.com/p/create" target="_blank">Piskel</a> to create art to put into PxlsFiddle.</dd>
            <dt>How do I move a template?</dt>
            <dd>Hold <kbd>CTRL</kbd> (or <kbd>OPTION</kbd> on macOS) and click and drag to move it around. On mobile, you can tap and hold where you want to move the template and click "Move Template Here" in the pop-up.</dd>
            <dt>Does the canvas reset? When?</dt>
            <dd>Yes. The canvas resets when it is completely full. A reset date is not usually decided until the canvas is full, but the average canvas life-span is around 1 month. Updates are posted in our <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord server</a> when a reset date is set.</dd>
            <dt>Where can I see the past canvases?</dt>
            <dd>The past canvases are featured on our <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>, or the 3rd party website <a href="https://pxlsfiddle.com" target="_blank">PxlsFiddle</a>, which records timelapses and a lot of useful information on each canvas.</dd>
            <dt>How do I see who placed a pixel?</dt>
            <dd>By shift-clicking (or tap and hold on mobile) a pixel, you can see who placed a pixel, how many pixels they have placed, and when they placed it.</dd>
            <dt>How do I report someone?</dt>
            <dd>Shift-click (or tap and hold on mobile) on a pixel, and click the Report button.</dd>
            <dt>How do I change the color of my name in the chat?</dt>
            <dd>There is a "Username Color" option near the bottom of the settings panel.</dd>
            <dt>What is a "virginmap"?</dt>
            <dd>The virginmap shows which pixels have not yet been placed on (or “virgin” pixels).</dd>
            <dt>How do I report bugs?</dt>
            <dd>Submit bugs to the #dev-and-bugs channel in the <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>. If you have found an exploit, please message one of the staff members privately (through DMs).</dd>
            <dt>How do I get more info or contact staff?</dt>
            <dd>Check the info panel (the icon on the top left) for more details and links, or join our <a href="https://pxls.space/discord" target="_blank">Discord server</a>, where a staff member will gladly respond.</dd>
